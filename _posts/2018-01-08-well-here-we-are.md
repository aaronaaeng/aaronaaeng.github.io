After deciding once again that I will not become a web developer, I have finally gotten this up and running.  This will serve as a way for me to chronicle what I do for the whole world to see.  Since you're reading this, that probably means that I have already told you about a project of mine in gratuitous detail.  Now you can check back here to see the same information but in writing.

I'm just looking out for all of the visual learners out there.
