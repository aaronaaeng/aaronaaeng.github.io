My name is Aaron Aaeng and I am a junior in CU Boulder's computer science department.  

I'm setting this up to document some of the things that I do in the realm of software development and data science.  I will also be able to do post-mortems on some old projects of mine which will hopefully allow me to learn from my past projects and see just how far I've come.

Also, shoutout to Broccolini for making this incredible Swiss theme.
